Class 2 : Task 1 :-
You will be given a connected unweighted graph consisting of n nodes and m undirected edges. For each 1 <= i <= n you have to print all adjacent nodes of i.

Input :
First line you will be given 2 integers 1 <= n <= 10^5 and 1 <= m <= 2*10^5.
Then in the next m line of input you will be given two integers u and v where u and v both directly connected by an undirected edge. Here 1 <= u, v <= n.

Output :
Output will consist of n lines. In the i-th line, print all adjacent nodes of the i-th node separated by a single space in any order.

Sample :

Input :
5 4
1 2
2 3
2 5
5 4

Output :
2
1 3 5

Class - 2 : Task - 2 :-
You will be given an unweighted graph consisting of n nodes and m directed edges. You have to print all adjacent nodes of i where 1 <= i <= n.

Input :
First line you will be given 2 integers 1 <= n <= 10^5 and 1 <= m <= 2*10^5.
Then in the next m line of input you will be given two integers u and v where u and v both directly connected by a directed edge. Here 1 <= u, v <= n.

Output :
Output will consist of n lines. In the i-th line, print all adjacent nodes of the i-th node separated by a single space in any order. If the i-th node doesn't have any adjacent node then print a blank line. See samples for details.
Sample :

Input :
5 4
1 2
2 3
2 5
5 4

Output :
2
3 5


4

Note : 3rd and 4th line of sample is blank because node 3 and 4 doesnâ€™t have any adjacent nodes.
